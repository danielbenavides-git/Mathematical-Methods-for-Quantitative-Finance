## Course Overview

*Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance* focuses on the mathematical foundations required for modern quantitative finance and financial engineering. The course emphasizes rigorous analytical thinking combined with computational implementation, preparing learners to model uncertainty, analyze financial time series, and solve optimization problems commonly encountered in quantitative finance.

Key mathematical tools covered include probability theory, stochastic processes, linear algebra, optimization, and simulation methods, with practical applications implemented programmatically (primarily in **R**).
